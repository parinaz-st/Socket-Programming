Socket Programming Practice
This project is a simple chat application developed as part of my Computer Networks course during my B.Sc. studies. It demonstrates client-server communication using sockets in C#.

Features
Client-Server Communication: Uses TCP/IP sockets for real-time message exchange.
Simple UI: A Windows Forms interface for sending and receiving messages.

Technologies Used
C# for both client and server-side programming.
Sockets for network communication.
Windows Forms for the user interface.

How to Use
Start the server by running the server application.
Start the client by running the client application.
Enter the server IP and port in the client application to connect.
Once connected, the client and server can start sending messages to each other.
